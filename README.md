# IT-Reading-Notes

IT-Reading-Notes is a personal knowledge repository where I document my reading journey through books on programming, computer science, and information technology.

The goal of this project is to consolidate key concepts, insights, summaries, and reflections from each book I read, making it easier to revisit and internalize the material over time.
